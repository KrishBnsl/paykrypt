# PayKrypt

PayKrypt is an advanced fraud detection and secure banking system designed for the financial future of Viksit Bharat 2047, implementing cutting-edge cryptography and privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project creates a next-generation financial security infrastructure. PayKrypt combines sophisticated fraud detection capabilities with cryptographic methods to ensure long-term security and privacy in financial transactions.

## Data Preprocessing

The project includes extensive data preprocessing steps for the generated data:
- Feature engineering based on transaction time
- Quantile and power transformations for numeric features
- Dimensionality reduction techniques
- Probabilistic encoding for categorical variables
- Handling of missing values

## Data Generation Using GANs

PayKrypt uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic financial transaction data, taking the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset as a reference:
[IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data)

Key benefits of our GAN-based approach:
- Creates realistic transaction patterns that preserve statistical properties of real financial data
- Generates diverse fraud scenarios for comprehensive model training
- Enables unlimited training data without privacy concerns
- Simulates rare fraud patterns that might be underrepresented in original datasets

## Advanced Fraud Detection Methods

PayKrypt employs a multi-model ensemble approach to achieve state-of-the-art fraud detection accuracy:

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: Our CNN architecture treats transaction sequences as image-like structures to identify spatial-temporal fraud patterns
- **Multi-channel Feature Maps**: Separate channels process different feature categories (transaction amounts, timestamps, merchant categories)
- **Hierarchical Pattern Detection**: Deeper layers capture complex fraud patterns that traditional methods might miss

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
- **Sequential Transaction Analysis**: LSTM models capture long-range dependencies in customer transaction history
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies deviations from established customer behavior patterns
- **Temporal Fraud Signatures**: Recognizes specific temporal patterns associated with fraud

### Hybrid Model Architecture
- **CNN-LSTM Fusion**: Combines CNN's spatial pattern recognition with LSTM's temporal analysis
- **Adaptive Feature Importance**: Weights different features based on their predictive power
- **Ensemble Decision Making**: Final fraud determination uses weighted outputs from multiple models
- **Continuous Learning**: Models update in real-time as new patterns emerge while preserving privacy

## Homomorphic Encryption

PayKrypt implements encryption schemes for homomorphic encryption:

- **Secure Homomorphic Encryption**: Our system utilizes encryption schemes that protect sensitive data
- **Homomorphic Computation**: Enables computations on encrypted data without decryption
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Designed to adapt to evolving cybersecurity challenges

## Federated Learning System

PayKrypt implements a federated learning architecture with secure encryption:

- **Decentralized Model Training**: Each financial institution trains models locally on their own data
- **Secure Parameter Sharing**: Model updates are protected with homomorphic encryption
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verification of data integrity without revealing sensitive information
- **Secure Aggregation**: A central server aggregates encrypted model parameters without compromising security

This approach creates a nationwide secure financial network aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047's vision of technological sovereignty and advanced digital infrastructure.
